# Think Python Studios

For using in LC101.

Each folder is a studio that is divided up into two parts, a walkthrough and a studio. And each is prepared for students in the online textbook [Think Python][thinkcspy] (aka thinkcspy).

**Walkthrough**: An instructor-led activity that introduces new concepts that the students will put into practice in the studio.

**Studio**: An activity that students should work on in class, alone or in pairs. Studios gives students hands-on practice with new concepts.
